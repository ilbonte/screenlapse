It's like [telepath-logger](https://github.com/nwinter/telepath-logger), but worse and written in Python
# Requirements
 [VideoCapture](http://videocapture.sourceforge.net/)
 
 [OpenCV](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/doc/py_tutorials/py_tutorials.html/)
 
 [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)
 
 [PIL/Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.org/en/3.0.x/)

# TODO
* Delete old images before starting new timelapse or let the user choose an output folder to prevent overwrite
* GUI(PyQt)?
